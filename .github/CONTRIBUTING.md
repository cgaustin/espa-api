# How To Contribute

First off, thank you for considering contributing to espa-api!

Here are a few guidelines to get you started (but don't be afraid to ask 
questions if something is unclear!):

## Workflow

* No contribution is too small! Please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
* We never want to break backward compatibility. 

## Bug Tracker

A great way to contribute is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. 
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, and will thank you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/USGS-EROS/espa-api/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. If you have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information 
that may help resolving the issue, please leave a comment. 

If you suspect your issue is a bug, please create your issue description by 
including the BUG REPORT INFORMATION [template](ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md).

Helpful information to consider when using the [Landsat Contact Us](https://landsat.usgs.gov/contactus.php) page for help and questions:
  * Your ERS login userid (**PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE PASSWORDS**)
  * The specific URL (Web address) for the page or data set you were attempting to access
  * The date and time you accessed our site
  * Your computer IP address (if you do not know your IP address, [google](https://www.google.com/#q=ip+address) can tell you)
  * The name of the data product, data set, or data variable you were searching for
  * The access method you are using (browser, curl, python)
    * If browser, the web browser name and version
    * if curl, the curl version (`curl -V`)
    * if python, the python version (`python -V`) and package name (urllib2, requests, etc.)
  * The platform you are using (mac, PC, linux) and operating system and the current version name and number (`uname -a`)
  * Provide additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.)
  * Any significant error messages seen in your session

Note that this information is not required -- providing it enhances our ability 
to assist you, and may reduce the time required to resolve your query.
